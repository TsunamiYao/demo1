PQMETHOD UPDATE HISTORY
=======================

PQMethod RELEASE 2.35 Nov-2014
------------------------------
* Bug introduced with version 2.35 (Windows version only) consisting in 
  scrambled Date and Time output in .lis, fax.dat and xfax.dat cleared.


PQMethod RELEASE 2.35 with PQROT 2.0  May-2014
----------------------------------------------
* Starting with the DOS version (required for Mac users for running
  PQMethod under DOSBox), PQROT now offers using alternative keys for
  F-keys and some of the special keys not easily to be found on the Mac.


PQMethod RELEASE 2.35 with PQROT 1.8  Mar-2014
----------------------------------------------
* To further secure compatibility with all Windows versions the STATES 
  and the VIEWLIST (former 'View project files ..') were redesigned, with
  setting default EDITOR and VIEWER environment variables to notepad.exe
  in the PQMethod.bat. 
* Both distributed PQMethod versions, for Windows and for DOS, are compiled 
  with GFORTRAN, not G77.


Release 2.34 Feb-2014
---------------------
* This version was updated and tested to be compatible also with GFORTRAN 
  (for Windows,DOS and Linux) in addition to G77 for DOS and for Windows
* Specifically, previous versions, when compiled with GFORTRAN, would have 
  crashed when PQMethod started to write out factor scores to fax.dat 
  or xfax.dat.
* In addition, the part in which PQROT is launched after trying to find its
  directory path, was redesigned. 
* Release 2.34 is distributed as source code only because the modifications
  have (nearly) no effect on the functioning of the executable.

Release 2.33 with updated PQROT 1.7 of Sep-2013
-----------------------------------------------
* PQMethod itself still version 2.33, but new version (1.7) of add-on 
  graphical rotation program, PQROT, which now allows resizing its window. 

Release 2.33 Dec-2012
---------------------
* Cleared bug that prevented deleting a sort with all zeroes

Release 2.32 Aug-2012
---------------------
* Cleared bugs introduced with 2.31, e.g. study status of QENTER did not
  report number of sorts

Release 2.31 May-2012
---------------------
* Added additional .tsv (tab-separated-values) output file format 
  for easier importing data in other software like excel

Release 2.30 Apr-2012 (not officially published)
---------------------
* Implemented the "HORST 5.5" method of Centroid extraction as an optional
  alternative to the existing Brown (1980) method. 
* CLeared a minor bug of 2.20 that consisted in not suppressing the output
  of the table with the "exact" factor scores in case of Centroid extraction.
* The Turbo-Pascal code of PQROT was successfuly ported to freepascal for windows,
  and the new PQROT version 1.5 can now be run under all versions of Windows, without 
  the help of DOSBox. 


Release 2.20 Dec-2011
---------------------
* SPSS-type, exact factor scores ("XFS") in addition to the Stephensonian 
  are now computed and output to the .lis and to file XFAX.DAT in T-score 
  units. Exact factor scores are computed only if QPCA (principal components) 
  were selected as method of factor extraction.
* Removed printing the content of the .qan (rotation history) in the .lis 
* Revised several table headings


Release 2.11 Nov-2002
---------------------
* Added new "Cumulative Communalities" table for QANALYZE output.
* Cleared bug in PQROT.exe (significance-test for "flagging" factors
  was based on No of sorts instead of No of statements)


Release 2.10 Aug-2002
---------------------
* Some "cosmetic" changes in .lis output (QANALYZE): 
  - "Correlations Between Factor Scores" instead of "... betw. Factors"
  - No factor-comparison tables if no. of (rotated) factors = 1 
  - SortIDs added in table with Means and Std.Dev.s
* Redesigned STATES to check for .sta file and allow for importing
  existing statements file (as it was possible before version 2.09 has 
  introduced the external editor) 
* Modified error message when QANALYZE does not find "enough 
  statements" (hint regarding possible missing hard return)
* An additional SPSS-syntax file, lipset_f.sps, is provided in the 
  projects sub-directory which demonstrates how to read PQMethod data
  and statements files with SPSS. 
* The executable (PQMethod.exe) is distributed in a Windows32 version 
  only. The DOS version, compiled with DJGPP, is discontinued but can
  be provided upon request. (The two version do not behave differently
  but the Windows32 version does not run under DOS-only, Win3.x, OS/2) 
  
Bug-Fix 2.09a Nov-2000
----------------------
* Bug-fix: 2.09 which should handle up to 299 sorts, in fact crashed
  in module Varimax when n > 120. Fixed

Release 2.09 Jan-1999
---------------------
* Added interface to external editor (launched from STATES) and to 
  external file viewer (launched from new menu option); inserted
  freeware programs ed.com and view86.com in distribution package
* Max. no of sorts is increased from 120 to 299 
* For date and time output (in header lines of .lis and fax.dat) 
  a Y2K compliant internal function replaces the less compliant one
* Created an alernative version of the executable, 'PQMetW32.exe',
  which does not (should not, at least) differ in any way, except that 
  it runs on certain hardware (IBM notebooks) where the DOS-Version 
  fails (requires Win9x or NT)
* Full path (where the project files reside) and project name are 
  displayed on screen as well as in the 2nd header line of 
  QANALYZE output
* After finishing QANALYZE return to main menue instead of exiting
* Fixed paging of rotated and unrotated factor loading table
* Improved trapping errors caused by 'abnormal data': QANALYZE issues
  a warning in case of zero communalities. QENTER does not accept a
  sort with zero variance (all items in one pile). When during 
  computation of correlations a sort with  zero variance is found 
  PQMethod exits with an error message. 
* In QENTER, error message added in case pile size exceeds max. of 50
* PQROT is searched and found in the same directory where PQMethod is,
  wherever that may be
* Providing full path name as part of project name works now as it 
  should (hopefully), also under NT. Directory separators can be 
  specified either as "/" or "\" 


'Snapshot' 2.08 July-18-1999
----------------------------
* At the moment, PQMethod 2.08 is not distributed with an 
  installation routine. Also, the Manual (PQMethod.doc), the readme.txt, 
  etc. are not yet updated, and therefore not included in the current 
  2.08 distribution package.
* Included is an additional program, PQROT.EXE, which provides a high-
  resolution graphic version of the old 'low resolution' QROTATE module.
  PQROT also provides enhancements in user-interface for rotation and 
  also for flagging factors (use Help-Key F1 for descriptions) .
  PQROT is automatically launched from within PQMethod 2.08 (though
  the user can as well decide to use the old QROTATE instead), but PQROT 
  can be used 'standalone' also.
* The 'Project Name', where necessary with the full path name of the
  directory where the project's PQMethod files reside, can be provided
  at the command line, e.g., with
     PQMethod c:\myqdata\projno1 , 
  files projno1.dat, projno1.sta, etc. in directory c:\myqdata will 
  already be opened upon start of PQMethod. (An added file name 
  extension, e.g., c:\myqdata\projno1.dat, is dropped automatically.)
  With this added feature it is now possible to use drag&drop or to
  configure the Windows-Explorer to open .dat files with PQMethod.
  Path and project name are shown on screen as well as in the output
  listing of QANALYZE.
* When QANALYZE outputs the rotated factor loading matrix, sorts are 
  checked for Zero communalities, and a warning is issued for such
  cases both on screen and in the .lis. In previous versions, PQMethod
  would have aborted abnormally when a case with Zero communality was
  encountered in QVARIMAX. (The probable reason for this situation is
  that the sort has no variance, i.e. all statements are sorted into 
  the same category; this sort should be deleted, and the analyses 
  repeated)
* Up to version 2.07, principal components (especially the first one) 
  were computed 'upside down', i.e., with mostly negative signs of 
  loadings. Though no real 'bug', and absolutely without consequence
  if a Varimax rotation follows, this unwieldy thing is now resolved.
* Decimals are printed now with leading Zeroes ('0.123' instead of 
  ' .123'; resulting from using newer version of GNU Fortran)

Release 2.06 October-22-1997
----------------------------
* Added output of a 'timestamp' line at the end of <project>.lis
  listing file, and corresponding date and time of analysis in the
  fax.dat output of QANALYZE
* PC-Version only: Used new G77 compiler configuration that fixed 
  file i/o bug that consisted in not correctly overwriting existing 
  (longer) output files with new (shorter) versions; under DOS-only,
  the bug which is fixed now, could effect FAT corruption.

Release 2.05 October-14-1997
----------------------------
* Fixed bug in QENTER that sometimes crashed the program when
  starting with a new project

Release 2.04 July-30-1997
-------------------------
* Fixed bug with case labels in Delete-Case function of QENTER.

Release 2.03 June-20-1997
-------------------------
* Redesigned correlation-matrix table. (All former versions listed
  incomplete _and erroneous_ correlation matrix when there were more 
  than 32 sorts)

Release 2.02 Beta June-01-1997
------------------------------
* Eventually fixed 'easter egg bug' (undetected since 2.0a 
  by all the eager alpha-testers!). Bug consisted in repeatedly
  asking user if s/he wanted to change the identification code in the
  course of entering corrections of pile numbers.
* Fixed some minor bugs: misleading error messages in QCENT and QPCA;
  leaving empty .rot undeleted. 
* QCENT outputs a WARNING message if there is a 'Heywood case' 
  (communality exceeds unity), and offers the choice either to adjust
  or not to adjust loadings 

Release 2.01 Beta May-20-1997
-----------------------------
* This is where numbering begins. 2.01 replaces Alpha-Test versions
  2.0a - 2.0f which were not distributed as self-install packages.
  It is the first version that contains PCA factoring.


Changes since the former release, version 1.10, are too many
to be listed here ....
