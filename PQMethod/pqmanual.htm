<h2><a name="about"></a>About</h2>

<p>PQMethod is a statistical program tailored to the requirements
of Q studies. Specifically, it allows to easily enter data
(Q-Sorts) the way they are collected, i.e. as 'piles' of
statement numbers. It computes intercorrelations among Q-Sorts,
which are then factor-analysed with either the Centroid or
Principal Component method. Resulting factors can be rotated
either analytically (Varimax), or judgmentally with the help of
two-dimensional plots. Finally, after selecting the relevant
factors and 'flagging' the entries that shall define the factors, the
analysis step produces an extensive report with a variety of
tables on factor loadings, statement factor scores,
discriminating statements for each of the factors as well as
consensus statements across factors, etc. </p>

<p>PQMethod was adapted, revised and is maintained by Peter
Schmolck. The FORTRAN-77 code on which it is based was originally
written for the mainframe by John Atkinson under the guidance of
Steven Brown at Kent State University. PQMethod is free, with all
the usual legal disclaimers, of course. The most recent version
can be downloaded from the <a href="http://schmolck.org/qmethod/">QMethod
Page</a>.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>The seemingly antiquated programming language FORTRAN is quite 
useful still for implementing mathematical-statistical algorithms, and 
additionally,
PQMethod's FORTRAN-77 source code can easily be ported to all types of 
computers. But FORTRAN is not itself designed for graphic user interface
 with mouse support, and it has no built-in possibilities for displaying 
results in graphic form. PQMethod users have learned to accept that 
PQMethod is no point-and-click Windows program, but graphic rotation and
 flagging of factors in the original, text-only mode (can be invoked 
still as the "old" version of QROTATE)&nbsp; was actually worse than 
just awkward to use. Fortunately, in 1999 Andreas Zollorsch, a student 
assistant at that time, created a user friendly software for that 
purpose as a separate program (PQROT)&nbsp; that can automatically be 
launched from within PQMethod. Unfortunately, however, PQROT, written in
 Turbo-Pascal, cannot easily be ported to platforms that do not fully 
support MS-DOS, like Windows Vista and later. Therefore, beginning in 
May 2008, PQMethod for Windows was provided as a package bundled with 
the free DOS emulator software <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>.
 In the same vein, a DOSBox version of PQMethod has also been created 
for Mac OS X. In February 2012 I eventually managed to port the PQROT 
Turbo Pascal code to the windows version of <i>free pascal</i>, and since version 2.3x there exist windows versions of PQMethod.exe and PQROT.exe that do not require DOSBox anymore. <br>
</p>Following the tradition originating from the original, mainframe 
QMethod software, all steps from entering sorts and statements to the 
analysis and viewing the results can be accomplished without leaving the
 program. For entering and editing the statements and for viewing the 
results, external software is required, and therefore the PQMethod 
distribution package until version 2.33 contained two additional tiny
freeware DOS-programs for editing and viewing
text files, the editor <i>SSH ED (=ed.com)</i> authored by <a href="http://shh.thathost.com/">Sverre H. Huseby</a>, and the text viewer <i>view86.com</i> which originates from the <a href="http://www.aldridge.com/">Aldridge Company</a>.
 Because 64bit versions of Windows 7 and later discontinued all DOS 
compatibility, the two tools were removed from the PQMethod 
distribution&nbsp; version 2.35 (except for the DOSBox version). For 
more details on editing and viewing statements and the output listing 
see sections <a href="#states">STATES</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; and <a href="#view">VIEWLIST</a>. <br>
<br>
PQMethod comes with the <i>'Lipset'</i> example data set which
is identical to the one used in the 'Technique and Method'
chapter of Steven Brown's textbook [Brown, S.R. (1980). <i>Political
subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science</i>.
New Haven: Yale University Press]. The nine sorts -- a very small
P sample, even in terms of Q -- were selected by Steven Brown
from a larger sample of cases for didactical purposes. 

<p>This <i>manual</i> itself originates from the QMethod-Help
file which is part of the original QMethod system for the
mainframe, and authored by John Atkinson (and / or Steven Brown).</p>

<hr width="60%">

<p><font size="4"><b><i>Requirements:</i></b></font> PQMethod for 
Windows now runs on all versions of Windows. There also exists an MS-DOS
 version of PQMethod that can be run with the free MS-DOS emulator <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>
 which is available for Mac OS X and Linux (and Windows). For both, Mac 
and Windows, exist PQMethod download packages that are bundled together 
with the DOSBox emulator. The PQMethod.exe executable for MS-DOS 
contained in the package may not be the latest release, but can be 
updated by downloading a separate zip file with the latest release of 
the executable (and accompanying PQManual). <br>
</p><p><font size="4"><b><i>Limitations:</i></b></font> The maximum
values allowed in PQMethod are <i>299 sorts</i> (subjects) and <i>200
statements</i>. The maximal number of factors that will be
extracted is <i>8 factors</i>. The Q-Sort design may have a
maximum of <i>13 piles</i> or columns, with a maximal <i>pile
size of 50</i>. The maximal length of statements displayed in the
output listing is <i>60 characters</i> (excess of text will be
truncated).<br>

<h2><a name="installing"></a>Installing and Launching PQMethod <br>
</h2>The present versions of the PQMethod download packages do not 
automatically self-install the software. At the moment, instructions for
 installing PQMethod can be found on the PQMethod download page only. <br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><a name="procedure"></a>General Flow and Procedure</h2>

<p>The system is composed of several pieces which lead from the
individual Q-Sorts which you collect to a final analysis of the
data. The first option, STATES, allows you to edit a file where
you will enter the text of the q-sort statements. These are not
used again until the QANALYZE routine at the end. Next is a
routine called QENTER which allows you to enter the data directly
from the sorts that you have collected. The next step consists in
creating a correlation matrix from the raw sorts, and performing
a factor analysis on the correlation matrix. This is the first
point where you have to choose between two alternatives: Select
QCENT for a Centroid factor analysis, or QPCA for Principal
Component analysis. After that, you need to choose a rotation
method, and PQMethod gives you the choice of QROTATE, which
allows you to manually rotate the factors, or QVARIMAX, which
performs a varimax rotation on the factors. Finally, the rotated
factor matrix is input to the QANALYZE routine, which
differentiates the factors based on the original q-sort
statements. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, let's look at the overall procedure and then the
individual routines in more detail.</p>

<p>For any study, you need to establish one name. This name will
be the file name of all files associated with the project, so it
must conform to the standards of MS-DOS filenames: from 1 to 8
characters. For the example that follows, we will use the name <i>mystudy</i>.
<b><i>Note:</i></b> Using the name <i>lipset</i> instead would
give access to the ready-to-use example data set. You can skip
routines 1 and 2 and start with 3 - QCENT or 4 - QPCA for an
analysis of the 'Lipset study' example.</p>

<p>When you start PQMethod you will be asked for the project
name, and after entering the name ('mystudy') you will see Screen
1:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<table cols="1" border="2" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><pre>  Enter [Path and] Project Name:

<p align="center">Screen 1 </p>



<p>From this point, we simply choose the routine we want to run,
starting with STATES. <br>
</p>

<p>Though STATES is #1 in the main menu, you can as well postpone
execution until you are ready to perform the final QANALYZE
routine.</p>

<h3><a name="states"></a>1 - STATES</h3>

<p>Choosing option #1 provides the possibility to enter the
statements: For this purpose PQMethod opens an external editor program 
for you (Notepad.exe in the Windows version of PQMethod). Every 
statement must be typed as a single line (without empty
lines between them). Note that all records will get truncated to
60 characters in the final output listing, since that is the
maximum for statement text in PQMethod.&nbsp; You might think about
appropriately abbreviating longer statements, instead of having
them truncated by the program. <br>
</p><p>It is essential that the
statements are in the correct order (the same as the numbers that
were used to enter in the q-sorts). You do not need to number
each statement, however, as they will be labeled on the output in
the QANALYZE module. Just be sure to enter the statements in the
correct order. When you are finished with
editing (dont't forget the final <em>hard return</em> after the
last statement!), exit the editor program for returning to
PQMethod. As a matter of fact, you can also create your statements file with the name &lt;project&gt;.sta (<i>e.g., mystudy.sta</i>) on your own, and copy it into the projects folder where your other &lt;projects&gt;.* files are. <br>
</p>
<p>Since version 2.35 of PQMethod the somewhat awkward alternatives 
of&nbsp; 'importing' statements from an existing file or entering 
statements without an editor program were discarded, as well as the 
automatic cutting of the statements to 60 characters. As mentioned above, the QANALYZE module cannot print more 
than 60 characters of statement text. But there is no such limit in 
statement length&nbsp; for the pair of little tools, <a href="http://schmolck.org/qmethod/addfls.htm">PQM2HTM / PQM2MHTM</a>&nbsp; that can be used to visualize every sort of your project's .dat file in a q-sort format. </p>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3><a name="qenter"></a>2 - QENTER</h3>

<p>QENTER is used to enter data directly from the q-sorts you
have administered. The file that is created by QENTER can be
created by another source, but it must be modified for entry to
factor analysis, etc. See the appendix for details about record
formats. </p>

<p>When you run QENTER, you don't have to enter all of the
q-sorts at one time. You can quit whenever you like and continue
data entry the next time you run QENTER. This is the first
question QENTER asks you. However, if this is the beginning of
data entry, you will need to enter a title for the study (up to
68 characters), and all of the details of the q-sort design used.</p>

<p>The screen you see at first will be as in Screen 2. Note that
you will only enter the title if you are <i>not</i> continuing
data entry.<br>

<p align="center">Screen 2 <br>
</p>The details needed will be: 

<ol>
    <li>The total number of statements that were sorted.</li>
    <li>The value of the leftmost column of the q-sort. It is
        assumed that the leftmost column has a lower value than
        the rightmost column, so that values will range from,
        say, -4 to +4, or from 1 to 9. The maximal number of
        columns is 13, with values ranging from either -6 to +6,
        or from 1 to 13. In general, there should be an unequal
        number of categories to provide for a neutral midpoint.
        If that is not the case, PQMethod issues a warning, but
        accepts the design.</li>
    <li>The rightmost column value (see above).</li>
    <li>The number of rows in each column, from left to right.
        This should exactly match your q-sort design. The design
        itself should be symmetric -- that is, the number of rows
        on the left should be the same as those of the
        corresponding columns on the right. In addition, the
        design must be unimodal -- that is, the number of rows
        must not decrease from either left or right to the
        center.</li>
</ol>

<p>Screen 3 shows what this detail entry would look like.
Remember, this is only entered the first time for any design. A
file containing this data is created so you can continue entering
data later or go back and modify or delete previously entered
sorts. <br>

delete, or show any sort, as well as query the current Q design.
The first time through, of course, we will choose to <i>add</i> a
new sort, as shown in Screen 4 (note that the request can be a
lower case letter).</p>

<p>On many of the following screens, you are asked to enter

<p>Then you will be prompted for the values for a single person
one column at a time, starting from the left (lowest value)
column. Although the design has to be symmetrical, the individual
q-sorts do not, so you can enter 3 values, for example, even if
the design says the column only contains 2. The entries do not
need to be in any order, such as ascending, but there must be a

<p>If you just hit the enter key in response to the above

you could give either '2' or '3'. If you first changed column 2

two 14's and no 13. So you could then change column 3 to contain
13, 21, &amp; 23. Most changes will require a couple of
iterations such as this.</p>

<p>When you are done entering q-sorts, you would answer 'N' to
the second question:</p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to enter another sort? (Y/n)</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><b><tt>n</tt></b><br>
<font size="2">(If you've inadvertently hit the enter key for Yes
instead of answering No, keep inputting empty inputs until the
question appears again.)</font></p>

<p>This will take you back to the QENTER menu where you can
choose other options if you wish. If you choose option X from
that menu, then the standard data file will still be written out,
so you can move on to the next stage (either QCENT or QPCA), but
also have the option of going back and adding, deleting, or
modifying sorts later.</p>

<p>When you exit QENTER, control returns to the menu.</p>

<p><i>Note on PQMethod's three raw data file formats.</i> There are 
essentially two formats of the Q-sort data matrix that are supported, 
and
automatically generated by QENTER: (a) the regular form with
sorts as rows and items as columns, and (b) the old inverted form
(used by mainframe QMethod and PQMethod 1.xx) with items as rows
and sorts as columns. The file &lt;project&gt;.dat, which is
required as input to QCENT / QPCA and to QANALYZE contains the
data matrix in the regular format (a). The file
&lt;project&gt;.raw which is of the form (b) might be useful if
you wish to analyse your Q-sort data with another statistical
software package. QENTER always outputs the data entered in both
file versions, and it also converts between file formats
automatically. If only either one of the two files exists, the
other one will be created. For instance, if you have got the file
oldstudy.raw that you once created with a former version of
QMethod software, all you need to do for creating the
oldstudy.dat file is to start QENTER once, and e(X)it it
immediately again. Since version 2.31, an additional, output only, 
tab-separated, format was added that might prove useful in the future 
for importing the PQMethod generated data into another, modern Q 
software. For further details see <a href="#appdxa">Appendix
A</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="qcent"></a>3 - QCENT and&nbsp;<a name="qpca"></a>4 -
QPCA</h3>

<p>QCENT (Centroid analysis) and QPCA (PCA, Principal Components
analysis) are <i>alternative</i> options for extracting
(unrotated) factors. Centroid analysis, the method of choice for
Stephenson and his followers, is not much used outside the Q
community nowadays, whereas Principal Components analysis is the
default method of factor extraction in statistical packages like
SPSS. </p>

<p>Both, QCENT and QPCA first take the rawdata file created by
QENTER and compute and output a correlation matrix into a file
with file-name extension .cor. Then, an unrotated factor loadings
file (.unr) is created by the application of the respective
method of factor analysis. <br>
</p>
<p>Since version 2.30, QCENT offers the option of choosing between two 
methods of Centroid extraction, the customary method described in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brown </span>(1980), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Horst</span>'s (1965) method with iterative solutions for communalities. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Brown Centroids:</span> As a default, it suggests the <i>'magical number' of
seven Centroids</i> to extract. However, you can change that; the
maximal number of factors PQMethod can handle is eight. In fact,
under normal conditions, there is no good reason for selecting
less than 7 factors, since upon rotation of factors you can
choose how many of the unrotated factors to use. <i>QPCA</i>
always computes <i>eight factors</i>, which is the maximum number
of factors PQMethod can process. This does not mean that you have
to take into account all factors up to the eighth for either
judgmental or Varimax rotation which follow later. <b><i>Note:</i></b>
In "<span style="font-style: italic;">Brown-Centroid</span>" as well as <span style="font-style: italic;">PCA</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">but not in "Horst-Centroid</span>",&nbsp; the composition of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. factors
extracted do not depend in any way on how many (additional)
factors are extracted altogether. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Horst's&nbsp; Centroid </span>method
 uses a somewhat more refined approach in the way the diagonal entries 
in the correlation matrix are estimated, and it was implemented in 
PQMethod because it did not show certain irregularities that were found 
with several data sets when analyzed with the customary Centroid method.
 <br>
You can either determine how many factors to be extracted (max. 8) 
or&nbsp; let the program determine when to stop extracting factors 
according to what Horst suggested as the limiting level of residual 
correlations (average r<sup>2 </sup>&lt; 1/NITEMS). Since in this method
 the final communalities are iteratively entered as diagonal entries in 
the initial correlation matrix, all factors in a solution depend on the 
number of factors the user asks to extract. The final average residual 
correlation is displayed on screen, and the iterated series of 
communality estimates and the residual correlation matrix are written 
after the factor loading matrix in the unrotated-factors file (.unr).<br>
  <br>


</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">QPCA </span>computes and outputs all <i>Eigenvalues</i> (and
corresponding percentage figures) on screen as well as to the
unrotated-factors file (.unr). The absolute and relative sizes of
the Eigenvalues are of some importance when deciding on how many
factors to keep for rotation.<br>

<h3><a name="qrotate"></a>5 - QROTATE</h3>

<p>Now it is time to rotate the factors. You have two options:
you can rotate the factors by hand, or you can perform a Varimax
rotation (as described in the next section). You would not
normally do both, unless you wanted to compare the methods. If
you choose QROTATE to rotate the factors yourself, you are first
asked if this is a continuation. If you say 'no', then the file
output by QCENT or QPCA, respectively, the unrotated factors file
(.unr), will be the only input. If you say this is a
continuation, then an intermediate file (.hro) created the last
time you ran QROTATE is used instead. In either case, at the end
of this session, a new intermediate file is written out, and you
always have the option of running QROTATE again and using either
this file or the original file of unrotated factors (if you want
to start over). </p>

<dl compact="compact">
    <dt><b><i>Note</i></b></dt>
    <dd>Since version 2.08, PQMethod comes with a separate MS-DOS
        program, PQROT.EXE, for graphical factor rotation. After
        choosing QROTATE from the main menu you will be asked (if
        not so, PQROT.EXE was not found in the pqmethod directory
        on your disk):</dd>
    <dd><br>
<tt>&nbsp; Do you want to launch the new PQROT program
        (Y/n)?</tt><br>
<br>
        If you accept, PQROT is launched, and
        you can continue with performing hand-rotation using
        high-resolution graphics. PQROT provides, in addition to
        much more appropriately displaying the individual sorts
        in the factor plots, a highly improved interface for
        rotating axes, highlighting cases, flagging factors etc.
        The details of using PQROT instead of the old, text-mode
        QROTATE are not documented in this manual. However, you
        can easily find your way by following instructions on
        screen, and requesting help pages by pressing <b><i>F1</i></b><i>
        (I highly recommend inspection of the help pages for
        finding all available features!)</i>. One point needs
        mentioning, though: Most input to the program requires
        just <i>hitting certain keys</i> on the keyboard, <i>without
        pressing the &lt;ENTER&gt; key</i> (= <b><i>CR</i></b>,
        carriage return) also.&nbsp; <br>
</dd><dt><br>
</dt>

</dl>



<p>First, QROTATE will list the factor loadings for you, and you
must then choose which factors you would like to rotate. You will
work on just one pair of factors at a time, but you can always go
back to a pair later. Once you establish an appropriate angle
between factors 1 and 2, you can then rotate 1 and 3, or 2 and 3,
for instance, without affecting the angle between 1 and 2. Once you have rotated
the axes to your satisfaction, the current array of factor
loadings will be displayed again.</p>

<p>You rotate factors simply by giving a number of degrees. A
positive number rotates the axes clockwise, and a negative number
counter-clockwise. Your goal is to get clusters of subjects close
to an axis. This would generate the highest possible loadings on
that factor for those subjects. In addition, it is advisable to
attempt to load subjects positively, so you want to do rotations
which leave subjects close to the positive axes (the ones at 12
o'clock and 3 o'clock). A rotation of 180 would reverse the
orientation of both axes, for example. Reversing the orientation
of one factor only without affecting other factors is possible
with a little trick: Plot this factor against itself, and then
rotate the axes 180 degrees. -- <i>The new PQROT provides a
special function for inverting a factor!</i></p>

<p>If you press &lt;ENTER&gt; without entering a rotation, you
can then choose another set of factors to rotate.</p>

<p>When you are done rotating, simply press &lt;ENTER&gt; instead
of the numbers of two factors to rotate.</p>

<p><i>'Flagging' factors:</i> Now you can choose to associate
particular subjects with factors. This is necessary for input to
the QANALYZE routine that will come next, so you want to do this
if you are ready to move on. You can pass if you are going to
come back and do more rotating later. If you choose to flag
factors now, press &lt;ENTER&gt;. However, if you wish the
program to 'pre-flag' factors first, press &lt;<b>p</b>&gt;.</p>

<p>The flags provided automatically by PQMethod may not be
exactly what you want, but at least you can see how the result of
flagging the factors might look like, and thereafter you can go
over each factor in turn, and make your own selections -- or
accept the pre-flagging for a first test run of QANALYZE. (The
QANALYZE module calculates a synthetic Q-sort, or <i>factor prototype sort</i>, for each factor
consisting of a weighted average of the sorts of those subjects
that were flagged for the factor.)</p>

<p>To flag specific subjects, simply enter the number of the
factor when asked, and then enter the subjects (sorts) to be
associated with that factor. After you have done this, the matrix
is displayed again for you, and you can flag another factor.</p>

<p>When you are done flagging factors, you choose which factors
you want to write to the output file, the file that will be the
input to QANALYZE. The type of this file will be 'rotated factor
matrix' (file extension .rot). The factors are written to the
file in the order you specify, so you can choose the order that
is most natural (first write out the factor associated with the
first subject, etc.).</p>

<p>At least one of the factors written to the output file (.rot)
must be flagged for at least one subject, 'unflagged' factors are
automatically dropped by QANALYZE.</p>

<p>If you change your mind later about the subjects flagged, you
can edit the .rot file and change any flags desired.&nbsp; -- <i>The
new PQROT provides an easier an secure interface for editing
flags!!</i></p>

<p>See Appendix B for an example of hand rotation.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="qvarimax"></a>6 - QVARIMAX</h3>

<p>If you choose not to rotate the factors yourself, you can
choose a varimax rotation. QVARIMAX takes in the unrotated matrix
file (.unr) created by QCENT or QPCA, and asks for the number of
factors you wish to rotate. If you just press the &lt;ENTER&gt;
key, <i>all </i>unrotated factors will be rotated to the Varimax
criterion (not usually to be recommended!). After the VARIMAX
rotation is performed, you are then given the option to do
further rotating by hand if you want, or you can simply flag the
factors and write them out, just as you would if you had done the
entire rotation by hand. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<table cols="1" border="2" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><pre>    Last Routine Run Successfully - QPCA

<b>66<br>n </b>Performing VARIMAX rotation...
 How many factors do you wish to rotate?
 (Press &lt;ENTER&gt; to rotate all  8 unrotated factors)
<b>3
</b> 3 Varimax factors will be output to file c:/pqmethod/projects/lipset.rot


 Next, varimax factors will be displayed for additional rotations [optional]
 and for adding flags [required] - Do you wish to use the
 new PQROT program for that (Y/n)?
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p align="center">Screen 8 </p>

<p>Whether you only want to flag factors (which is required
before running the final QANALYZE step) or do further hand
rotating, the new PQROT program can be used for both. See section
(5) QROTATE for details.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="qanalyze"></a>7 - QANALYZE</h3>

<p>Finally, you need to choose QANALYZE (#7 from the main menu)
to give you a complete analysis of the q-sorts you collected. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<table cols="1" border="2" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><pre><b>7

</b>  PQMethod is going to write the report into the file
          c:/pqmethod/projects/lipset.lis
  with max. 132 chars/line and  52 lines/page
  Do you want to change no. lines/page? (y/N):
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p align="center">Screen 9 </p>

<p>You may simply press &lt;ENTER&gt; at this point, and accept
the default of 52 lines/page, since you can repeat this step
later again. Considerations regarding printing the report listing
will be discussed later in this section.</p>

<p>QANALYZE uses the statement file (extension .sta) that
contains the text of all the statements, the raw-data file (.dat)
that is generated by the QENTER routine (or provided beforehand as a plain text file)&nbsp; and the rotated factor
loadings (.rot) file that was created by QROTATE or QVARIMAX. In
addition, just for display purposes, it uses the correlations
file (.cor), and the unrotated factor matrix file (.unr).</p>

<p>QANALYZE stops processing with an error message if any of the
required files either is not found or is incomplete (e.g., factor
loadings in the .rot file not flagged, see section <a href="#qrotate">5-QROTATE</a>). <br>
</p>

<p>When run, QANALYZE creates a written report in a listing file
(.lis) that is actually sent to disk, just like all the other
files in this system. You can view this file with option #8 (see <a href="#view">next section</a>) and look at it on-line, and, after
finishing PQMethod, (edit and) print it out with your favorite
text program.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="printing"></a>Printing</h4>

<p>Printing the listing file (.lis) is best accomplished with the
help of a text program (like Word or Wordpad). Having loaded the
file, choose either landscape or portrait orientation for page
setup, and select the entire text for formatting type and size of
font. Be sure to choose a fixed-pitch font (e.g., <i>Courier New</i>)
and a font size small enough such that lines would not be broken.
The QANALYZE default for the number of lines/page, 52,
corresponds to landscape page orientation, and a font size of 8
(15 pitch, characters per inch). Printing in portrait page
orientation would allow double the number of lines per page, but
requires a tiny font size of 6 or 5 (20 or 24 pitch) and somewhat
reduced margins. <b><i>Note:</i></b> Usuallly, not all of the
tables produced by QANALYZE are required for interpretations; for
printing only parts of the report, simply delete the remainder.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="factor_scores"></a>Factors, Factor Scores, Factor Arrays, and 'Exact' Factor Scores</h4>
<p>In the PQMethod output factors are referred to in a confusing number 
of different ways. And because version 2.20 introduces an additional 
variant, the 'exact' factor scores, it seems appropriate for the updated
 PQManual to provide a reasonably comprehensive account on the meaning details of factors and their scores. <br>
</p>
<p>In Q factor analysis persons (or, more generally: sorts) <span style="font-style: italic;">load </span>on factors, statements have <span style="font-style: italic;">scores </span>on factors. <br>
</p>
<p>A factor is <span style="font-style: italic;">defined </span>basically
 by a selection of persons&nbsp; who unambiguously load highly on the 
factor, as shown in the&nbsp; factor (loading) matrix. For the <span style="font-style: italic;">interpretation </span>of
 the factors knowing these persons and their factor loading coefficients
 is of comparably little value. Of more relevance are the perspectives of these 
persons as revealed in their individual q-sorts, and the common themes 
running through their&nbsp; individual views which as a generalized, 
shared perspective make their sorts correlate highly with one and the 
same factor.&nbsp; The central goal of the analysis consists in the 
creation of one idealized, <span style="font-style: italic;">prototype sort</span>
 for each factor as the best possible, intrinsically coherent, 
representation of what is general in the individual views associated
 with the factor. <br>
</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Factor z scores or simply, factor scores:</span>
 The individual sorts that were "flagged" by the user as the best 
representatives of the factor are aggregated or "averaged" into one set 
of statement scores. The exact computational procedure consists in first
 z-standardizing every sort, and then applying different weights for 
every sort depending on the sort's factor loading, and computing the 
weighted average. Finally, every factor score is z-standardized again, i.e. 
every&nbsp; factor score has the same mean (0) and standard deviation 
(1), and hence scores are directly comparable across factors. The 
formula for the factor weights, according to Brown (1980) originates 
from Spearman (1927): <br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>w</big><big><sub>ij</sub></big> <big>= a<sub>ij</sub> / (1 - a<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub>) </big><br></pre>
<p>where <var>a<sub>ij</sub> </var>is the factor loading of the <var>i</var>th individual on the <var>j</var>th factor, and <var>w<sub>ij</sub> </var>is
 the weight. Compared to the regression approach&nbsp; for the 
computation of exact factor scores (á la SPSS, see below), this 
is a very simple formula. In effect the weights overproportionally 
increase the impact of higher loadings on the respective factor. <br>
</p>
<p>The way factor scores are computed in Q methodology accomodates the 
fact that the groupings of persons that are selected as factor 
representatives do not usually fall into orthogonal positions in factor 
space, as do the factor axes themselves which are located for 
representing the configuration of sorts with maximal parsimony. Factor 
scores therefore usually are correlated to at least a small to medium 
degree, with the size of the correlations reflecting the relative degree
 of similarity vs. distinctiveness. <br>
</p>
<p>Over-factoring, i.e., rotating more factors than there exist distinct
 perspectives, results in conspicuously high factor score 
intercorrelations. A reasonable rule of thumb would not, except for well
 founded reasons, accept a factor solution with factor score 
intercorrelations in the order of magnitude of the factor loadings of those sorts that appear suited to represent a factor. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ranks:</span> As
 an intermediate step the factor scores are rank-ordered, and the 
statements'&nbsp; factor scores with their associated ranks are reported
 in a synoptic table. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Factor Arrays with Q-Sort Values:</span>
 Based on the rank orderings of their factor Z scores, the statements 
are "sorted" for each factor into the q-sort "slots" from, e.g., -4 to 
+4. It may&nbsp; be noted here that this (non linear) transformation of 
the factor scores is nothing but a matter of convenience. An array of 
weighted averages of q-sort arrays that each follows a  forced-choice 
distribution does <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>naturally fall into the same form of distribution. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="exact_factor_scores"></a>'Exact' Factor Scores:</span>
 What I, for the sake of clarity, call 'exact' factor scores here&nbsp; 
is the normal version of factor scores outside the Q methodology 
context. In the case of principal component extraction these factor 
scores are not estimates only but identical with the factors. They are 
uncorrelated, and&nbsp; the sorts' correlations with the factor scores 
do not differ from their factor loadings (except for small rounding 
deviations). The exact factor scores are <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>computed if <span style="font-style: italic;">Centroid </span>extraction was selected. 
They are printed in two different scales, the z- and the T-scale. 
Compared to the z-scale (mean 0, std dev 1) the T-scale (mean 50, std 
dev 10) simply has the advantage of non-negative numbers without 
decimals. This format was chosen because it allows to write the scores 
out with sufficient precision in the PQMethod data format that allows 
for two digits only (see next section). <br>
</p>
<p>I did not implement the exact factor scores as an alternative to be 
used for factor interpretation. In my view the orthogonal factors as 
operationalized by their exact scores are artificial composites 
incorporating the views of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>persons

 with varying positive and negative (!) weights. The main application I 
had in mind for which the exact factor scores are better suited than the
 conventional factor arrays lies at the interface between Q methodology 
and psychometric or survey research applications: If the Q factor 
loadings shall be used as measures of a person's relative affinities to 
the perspectives associated with the factors, then the q-sorts of new 
persons or new samples of persons can be projected into the factor space
 of the derivation sample by correlating their q-sorts with the exact 
factor scores from this original sample. For this purpose the exact 
factor scores are preferable to the conventional Q factor scores 
(either&nbsp; z-scores or q-sort values) for two reasons: They make use 
of all available information for explaining&nbsp; the maximal possible 
amount of variance (in the oiginal sample), and due to their orthogonality they avoid mutual 
confounding of the factor measures as a consequence of built-in overlap.
 Another potential application consists in the systematic comparison of 
the factors from factor analysis solutions with differing numbers of 
factors. This offers the possibility to see how factors at consecutive 
steps of analysis (1, 2, 3 ... factors rotated) may appear again with 
little change or split in two, etc. before dwelling on the detailed 
interpretation of all the factors from every solution. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Important note:</span> There is a trick of the trade for splitting a bipolar 
factor that amounts to saving the same factor, with reversed signs, 
twice. PQMethod does not check for that irregularity in the factor 
loading matrix (.rot) and outputs faulty results in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Exact Factor Scores</span> table this case. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="exporting"></a>'Exporting' factors</h4>

<p>Both versions of factor scores are written into files for using the 
scores as data input for separate analyses. The conventional, q-sort 
value<i> 'factor arrays'</i>&nbsp; are output into the file <span style="font-style: italic;">fax.dat</span>, the <span style="font-style: italic;">'exact' factor scores</span>&nbsp; (in T-scale values) into the file <span style="font-style: italic;">xfax.dat</span>.
 PQMethod does not overwrite these output files with every new run, the 
new data are appended instead at the end of the existing files, every 
time QANALYZE is run. Every entry in the files is formatted like a 
PQMethod raw-data
file, with the first header line containing project name, and
date and time of the QANALYZE run that produced it. Importing
factors from <span style="font-style: italic;">fax.dat</span> or from <span style="font-style: italic;">xfax.dat</span> into a PQMethod raw-data file
<span style="font-style: italic;">(.dat)</span> requires manual editing; see <a href="#appdxa">Appendix A</a>
for details on how a .dat file has to be set up. <br>
</p>
<p>The most typical applications for the <span style="font-style: italic;">conventional factor scores</span> are s<span style="font-style: italic;">econdary factor analysis and 'spiking':</span> <br>
Secondary or second-order&nbsp; factors in the strict sense are 
higher-order, or simply: more general, factors that result from a 
second-step factor analysis of&nbsp; 'primary' factors extracted and 
obliquely rotated in a first step. This kind of analysis, though 
technically possible using PQMethod, does not appear to be particularly 
useful in Q methodology. Q researchers, however, use the term more 
loosely, when they analyze how factors from <span style="font-style: italic;">different </span>P
 samples relate to each other. Another technical variant of relating 
types of perspectives found in one P sample to those of another P sample
 consists in 'spiking' the data set of the one sample with the factor 
arrays of the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<span style="font-style: italic;"> 'exact' factor scores</span> 
are new in PQMethod, and future will show whether they will be found 
useful in applied settings where Q methodology based measurement 
instruments are sought for. The second kind of application suggested 
above, correlating factors from consecutive factor solutions with one, 
two, three, four, etc., was introduced as a practical way for 
structuring the interpretation process. Actually, from there it's only 
a small step to the intriguing 'bass-ackwards' method for "examining the
 
&nbsp;hierarchical structure of a set of variables, based on factor 
scores 
from rotated solutions involving one to many factors" introduced to 
personality psychology by Lew Goldberg (2006). It's not the place here 
for giving an introduction to the bass-ackwards method. If I could 
arouse your curiosity, though, get the Goldberg (2006) paper that 
contains several examples of graphical displays of hierarchical factor 
structures, and the tool for creating such diagrams (Levine, Schaaf, 
&amp; Goldberg, 2005): <br>

<h3><a name="view"></a>8 - VIEWLIST</h3>

<p>Choosing option #8 transfers control to an external 'viewer program' 
that opens the output listing, &lt;project&gt;.lis, which was created 
with <a href="#qanalyze">QANALYZE</a>. In the Windows version of PQMethod, the default 'viewer program' is the Windows Editor, notepad.exe.&nbsp; After
exiting the viewer program, PQMethod resumes control again.<br>
</p>
<p>VIEWLIST replaces the former 'View project files&nbsp; 
&lt;project&gt;.*' as implemented until version 2.34, which was meant to
 allow browsing through all the project's files not only the output 
listing. In the course of discarding the former little DOS tools for 
editing and viewing PQMethod files, no suitable free Windows software
 for browsing multiple files was found, and since this functionality 
deemed not really demanded in a Windows environment, the option #8 
was&nbsp; redefined. <br>
</p>


<p>The standard viewer program, <i>VIEW86</i>, has its own help
page accessed by pressing F1, but the most important key
functions will be given here as well:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><i>F4</i></b> &amp; <b><i>F3</i></b> for viewing next
        &amp; previous files</li>
    <li><b><i>F2</i></b> for switching between VGA and EGA (more
        lines displayed)</li>
    <li><b><i>Q</i></b> for exiting back to PQMethod</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note</i>: Newer versions of Windows may not support MS-DOS programs like <i>VIEW86 </i>any
 more. But you can always view a PQMethod project file by loading it in a
 text program like Notepad Editor. Files are free for external access 
not only after PQMethod is finished but also everytime you stop at the 
main menu. <br>

<h2><a name="algorithms"></a>Algorithms and formulas</h2>

<p>Most computations performed in PQMethod are designed after
concepts and formulas that are described in </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Brown, S.R. (1980). <i>Political subjectivity:
    Applications of Q methodology in political science.</i> New
    Haven: Yale University Press</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, the algorithm used for <strong><i>Centroid
extraction</i></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>,&nbsp; is fully documented in Brown (1980). <br>
</p>Among the procedures not included in John Atkinson's original
version of QMethod is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
'pre-flagging.' The newly (version 2.20) implemented 'exact' factor scores are described in section ' <a href="#factor_scores">Factors, Factor Scores, Factor Arrays, and 'Exact' Factor Scores</a> '.<br>




<p><strong><i>PCA</i></strong> is a standard, and mathematically
unambiguous procedure, that can be found in standard textbooks on
factor analysis. I have double-checked its implementation in
PQMethod against SPSS for several data sets. (The same is true
for Varimax rotation.)</p>

<p>The <strong><i>pre-flagging algorithm</i></strong> is designed
to flag 'pure' cases only, according to the rule: Flag loading<big> <b><i>a</i></b></big>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>if</i></b>&nbsp; <b>(1)</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>a</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup><tt>
    &gt; h</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup><tt>/2</tt> (factor
    'explains' more than half of the common variance) <b><i><br>
    and</i></b> <b>(2) &nbsp; </b><tt>a &gt; 1.96 / SQRT(nitems)&nbsp;</tt>
    (loading 'significant at p&gt;.05'). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that the selection of factor-defining sorts is a
matter of reasoned judgment, and as indicated by the prefix <i>'pre-'</i>,
this algorithm&nbsp; is <i>not</i> meant as a definitive
statistical solution for that -- notwithstanding the possibility
that your own judgment turns out to greatly coincide with what
the program suggests. </p>

<p><a name="communalities"></a>Since version 2.11, an additional
table, <em><strong>"Cumulative Communalities Matrix"</strong></em>,
is provided right after the unrotated factor matrix. The
communality,<tt> h</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup>, of a sort assesses
the proportion of its variance accounted for by the factors. <tt>h</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup>
is computed as the sum of the squared factor loadings (<tt>a</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup>)
, and therefore increases with the number of factors extracted.
Communality coefficients are not affected by factor rotation,
i.e., rotation of a given number of extracted (unrotated)
factors, does not change any sort's <tt>h</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup>.
The Cumulative Communalities Matrix is a synoptical table that
displays the <tt>h</tt><sup><tt>2</tt></sup> coefficients for any
number of extracted factors one might decide to keep for
rotation.<br>

<h2><a name="appdxa"></a>APPDX A - File Descriptions</h2>

<p>All files have the filename of the project that is entered
when PQMethod is first run. The file extension identifies each
individual file. The only files required for a new run of the
statistical analyses are the raw-data file (.dat) and the
statements file (.sta). </p>

<p>File formats are (upwards) compatible with all versions of
QMethod software, or can be converted with QENTER (old to new
raw-data formats). The .ent / $HLDENT$ file of version 1.x which
contained redundant information only, is obsolete since version
2.0.</p>

<h3>Formats of header lines (files .raw, .cor, .unr, .hro, .rot)</h3>

<p>The first two records are maintained in all project files
except .sta, .qan, .tsv, and .lis throughout the PQMethod routines. <br>

<h3>Files </h3>

<h4>.sta - Statements</h4>

<p>Each record contains the text of one statement. In text
programs, a record may be referred to as a <i>'paragraph'</i>,
and a record is finished with a <i>'hard return'</i> or paragraph
mark. Though the records in this file may be longer, only up to
60 characters of every record are read in. There must be exactly
as many records (without empty lines between them) in the file as
there are statements in the q-sort, and they must agree with the
numbers assigned to the statements in the sorts given. This file is
normally created with option #1. Note that statements in an
existing .sta file will be truncated to 60 characters when
running the STATES module. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h4>.dat - Q-sort data</h4>

<p>The first two records are standard. Thereafter, each record
contains the case label (the <i>Sort Id</i>) in columns 1-8 and,
starting at column 11, the values assigned for that sort for each
statement. Every response value is a 2-digit (right-justified)
number. The values of the data will range from the leftmost
column value to the rightmost column value. </p>

<p>The .dat file is normally created by manually entering q-sorts
in QENTER. It is required as input for QCENT/QPCA and for
QANALYZE. As described below, the .dat file can be created by
QENTER also by way of converting a .raw file. <br>
</p>
<p>PQMethod does not check any formal properties of the data read from 
the .dat file, e.g. it does not care whether or not a sort violated the 
prescribed forced-distribution. In fact, the calculations performed with
 the data, i.e., computation of intercorrelations between the sorts and 
computation of factor scores, do <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not </span>depend
 on any specific formal properties of the data. It's entirely up to the 
user to decide whether whatever kind of questionnaire data can be 
subjected to Q factor analysis with PQMethod. <br>
</p>


<h4>.raw - Q-sort data, transposed (old) format</h4>

<p>This is the old-format raw data file used in versions before
PQMethod 2.0. It is, however, still supported for input by the
new version, as well as output in addition to the new format .dat
file. The first two records are standard and each record after
that contains the values assigned by each sort for the statement
in I2 format (2-digits, right-justified) up to a maximal record
lenght of 80 (40 sorts), continuing on the next record(s) in case
there are more than 40 (80, ...) sorts. <i>Sort Ids</i>&nbsp; are
appended after the last record of the data matrix, every Sort Id
(consisting of max. 8 characters) on a separate record, and in
the same order as the sorts they designate. If an existing .raw
file is used as input to QENTER for file conversion, adding the
Sort Ids at the end of the file is optional --if not provided,
QENTER generates automatic Sort Ids. </p>

<p>The .raw file is created as output, and may be read as input
by QENTER according to the following logic: When started, QENTER
first tries to open the &lt;project&gt;.dat. If that does <i>not</i>
exist, it next tries to open the &lt;project&gt;.raw. In either
case, upon exiting, QENTER always writes out <i>both</i> versions
of the data, the .dat file and the .raw file. Therefore, both
directions of file conversion work, depending on which data-file
version exists or does not exist. However, note that QENTER does
not care for recency or comprehensiveness of the two files: if
both exist, it is always the .dat which is read in, and the .raw
which is overwritten! <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="tsv"></a>.tsv - Q-sort data, tab-separated-values output file <br>
</h4>
<p>This additional data output file is new in&nbsp; version 2.31 to 
allow for more easily importing PQMethod data into Excel and other 
modern software. For creating a .tsv file for an existing project with 
its .dat file, one only needs to select QENTER from the main menue, and e<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">X</span>it again. <br>
</p>


<h4>.cor - Correlation matrix</h4>

<p>Contains the two standard records followed by a correlation
matrix in '(8(F9.5,1X))' FORTRAN-type format. (This format will
be used by all the matrices in PQMethod.) </p>

<p>Output from QCENT/QPCA, read by QANALYZE for display purposes
only.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>.unr - Unrotated factor-loading matrix</h4>

<p>Normally this file is created by QCENT or QPCA, although it
can come from another source (e.g., you can compute Principal
Axes factors for your sorts with SPSS instead of PQMethod's
Centroids or Principal Components; be sure to create the .unr
file in the same format as used by PQMethod). Again, the first
two records are standard, but for the first time the field for
number of factors is used. The remainder of the file is the
matrix of factor loadings in '(8(F9.5,1X))' FORTRAN format.
Normally, there will be one record for every subject and seven or
eight factors across the file, although the number of factors
specified in the first record can be anywhere from 2 to 8. </p>

<p>Output from QCENT / QPCA, required as input for QROTATE /
PQROT, QVARIMAX, and QANALYZE.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>.hro - Backup of rotated factor-loading matrix</h4>

<p>This is a temporary file created by QROTATE / PQROT. It keeps
the latest (intermediate) state of the rotated factors, even if
you did not explicitely flag and save the rotated factors. In
this way, you can run QROTATE / PQROT for a second (or third ...)
time and take in this file which will reflect rotations made
previously. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h4>.qan - Q-angles</h4>

<p>Following a header, the records indicate the factors and the
angle of rotation for each hand rotation made. Up to PQMethod version 
2.11, the content of this file was echoed also in the listing file 
(.lis). Since
QROTATE / PQROT cannot always keep track of all rotations that
may have been performed in more than one session, the .qan rotation 
history can be misleading, e.g., if after manual rotations a Varimax 
solution was finally kept for the QANALYZE report. Therefore the 
rotation history is dropped from the report since version 2.20. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h4>.rot - Rotated factor-loading matrix</h4>

<p>The rotated factor matrix file created by QROTATE / PQROT or
VARIMAX will look very similar to the .hro file, except that
first, only those factors that have been specified will be
written to it, and second, factors are flagged, or should be
flagged, before you run QANALYZE. There must be at least one flag
('X' immediately behind the factor loading) for every factor
(column), and there should rather be no more than one flag for
any sort (row). <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h4>.lis - Listing</h4>

<p>The final report of the Q analysis, the matrix of
intercorrelations among the sorts, unrotated and rotated
factor-loading matrices, factor scores, comparing the factors,
listing the statements that differentiate the factors, etc. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="appdxb"></a>APPDX B - Example of Hand Rotation
(QROTATE)</h2>

<hr>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> What follows is the original Appdx B from
the QMethod-Help of the mainframe QMethod package. Maybe, some
time somebody might volunteer to write a hand-rotation tutorial
for PQROT. For the time being I'd suggest to consult the <a href="http://www.pcqsoft.com/tutorial.htm">tutorial</a> for <a href="http://www.pcqsoft.com/">PCQ for Windows</a> (commercial
Q-software by Mike Stricklin &amp; Ricardo Almeida) which is
based on the same 'Lipset example' data set, which is packaged
with PQMethod. When following the <a href="http://www.pcqsoft.com/example.htm">rotational steps</a> in
that tutorial with PQMethod / PQROT you should be aware, however,
that PQMethod and PCQ do not use the same algorithm for Centroid
extraction. The most notable differences for the Lipset data set
are found for the higher factor numbers. Specifically, factors 6
and 7 change positions (6 in PCQ is most similar to 7 in PQMethod
and vice versa), and factors 8 (and in PCQ, no. 9) show no
similarity at all between the two programs.&nbsp; </p>

<hr>

<p>Following is an example of how QROTATE is used to perform a
hand rotation of factors. You simply choose this option from the
main menu of PQMethod and answer the query of whether this is a
continuation of a rotation or not. If you say "no",
then the original unrotated factor matrix that was output by the
factor routine will be used. If you have already run QROTATE,
however, you can choose to continue that rotation instead, as the
(partially) rotated factor matrix is always kept when you exit
from QROTATE. Even if you have tried to rotate some factors, if
you say that this is not a continuation, then you will start with
the original unrotated matrix.</p>

<p>When the routine starts, it will present a listing of the
factor matrix with the entries truncated to fit easily on the
screen. In the following example, only six sorts were entered, so
there could be only six possible factors to rotate.</p>

<p>In this first rotation, factors 1 and 2 are chosen. At this
stage it is likely that we will want to view all of the points on
the graph so we ask to see all of the variables:</p>

<p>Now, we will see factors 1 and 2 graphed against each other in
the standard way, with each subject labeled. At this point, we
will probably want to rotate the factors to locate clusters of
variables near one factor. In this case, (an unnaturally clear
example, by the way), it should be obvious that a
counterclockwise rotation of around 40 degrees would put subjects
1, 2, and 3 close to the axis of factor 2, and 4, 5, and 6 close
to that of factor 1. (Remember that there is 90 degrees between
orthogonal factors, hence the midline would be a 45 degree
angle.) </p>

<p>It turns out in this case that the "-40" seems to
have been a very good estimate, and so we need no more rotation
of these factors. If we wanted to fine tune the rotation a little
here, we could easily continue to rotate the axes to and fro with
smaller rotations. (In this case, maybe another "-5"
would be appropriate.) </p>

<p>Instead, in this case, we just press the enter key, which
returns us to the factor matrix, but now it reflects the rotation
we have just made.</p>

<p>Here, we see that the loadings have been greatly affected by
our rotation, and that the first three subjects load heavily on
factor two, while the last three load on factor one. </p>

<p>Looking at the matrix, we see that there is still quite a bit
of variance accounted for by factor three, so perhaps another
rotation can pick up some of that.</p>

<p>In the same way that we rotated the two factors above, we
could now choose factors 1 &amp; 3, for example, and rotate them.
In this particular instance, we would probably choose to look
only at subjects 4, 5, and 6, however, since those are the three
that we are interested in loading on factor one. Obviously, this
process becomes more complicated when there are more than two
factors to be extracted for analysis.</p>

<p>After several rotations, we arrive at the matrix shown below,
and now we want to flag the entries that define the factors that
interest us. In this case, enter a null return to the question of
which factors to rotate. Just to ensure that we are done, we are
asked if we are done rotating. Another null return or an explicit
"N" will then allow us to mark entries.</p>
